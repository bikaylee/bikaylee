Hello! I'm Kaylee Deng, a senior year student at the UC Irvine studying Computer Science. Now, I am based in San Francisco, currently working on leetcode.

I am fascinated by the things that are related to computer. I started coding since High School and participated in different events like Oracle Conference, Developer Weeks, and multiple Hackathons. I enjoy learning and applying new languages and technologies in different kinds of projects. Through previous projects, I have learned React, Node.js, MongoDB, Python Flask, HTML/CSS, AWS and using OAuth2.0. 


I am looking for my first job as a Software Engineer! My graduation is expected to be in December 2021.
